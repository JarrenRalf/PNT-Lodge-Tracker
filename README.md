How does this spreadsheet benefit Pacific Net & Twine?
- This spreadsheet is used to keep track of our orders that involve the lodge, charter and guide sales in the company.
- It is a communication tool for all employees to have a quick over view of the status of each order.
- It also identifies to staff which items we are out of stock on and therefore need to order for our customers.
